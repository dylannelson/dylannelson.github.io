                We are a group of 3 students at UCSD looking to pursue an education in Data Science, and this is our journey
                at designing an autonomous vehicle

            <h2>Building</h2>

            <p><img src="images/chasis.PNG" class="console_image" alt="" />To the left is the initial step we took towards building
            We had to take apart the chassis of an RC car set, replace it with a more powerful motor, and prepare it for adding new equipment
            </p><hr>
            <p><img src="images/pcb.PNG" class="console_image" alt="" />On the right is a custom PCB that was made for this project.
                Developed by other ECE students, it provides the right power for the different equipment we will be using. Some of which include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a class = 'highlight' href="https://www.sick.com/us/en/detection-and-ranging-solutions/2d-lidar-sensors/tim5xx/tim571-2050101/p/p412444">Lidar</li></a>
                    <li><a class = 'highlight' href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-xavier-nx/">Jetson SBC (Xavier NX)</li></a>
                    <li><a class = 'highlight' href="https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d455/">Intel RealSense Camera (D445)</li></a>
                    <li><a class = 'highlight' href="https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/fs-esc-6-6">VESC Motor Controller</li></a>
                </ul> <hr>
            <p><img class="console_image" src="images/parts.PNG" alt="" /> We had to put all the 
                equipment together on a custom cut acrylic board so it could fit on the RC car chassis. Here 
                you can see <u>Jetson SBC</u> on top in a custom case, the <u>DC-DC converter</u> below
                it, and the <u>lidar</u> to the left, with the <u>camera system</u> mounted above it</p>
            
            <p><img class="console_image" src="images/body.PNG" alt="" />After it was all mounted, 
            this is what the body looked like. By adding some standoffs in holes where things were previously 
            on the chassis, it was a clean and sturdy fit</p><hr>
            
            <p><img class="console_image" src="images/under_frame.PNG" alt="" /></span> <b>Electrical-</b> This is the under-view of the
            chassis. Here are testing the voltage of the different ports of the PCB to ensure we don't blow up the
            at least $2k worth of equipment that will be using it. Once it was tested the battery barely pictured 
            in the bottom left is popped in and all components are plugged in to the PCB and the top is folded 
            ever and the car is complete (pictured above) </p> <hr>
            
            <p><img class="console_image" src="images/shox_rotated.png" alt="" /> <b>Shocks-</b> After that we changed  
            the shocks. After adding all that we did, we realized the car sunk way to low and would likely hit the
            floor with almost any gain in speed. These shocks are absolutely ideal. They have adjustable springs so 
            we can change the tension as we see fit (really important if we add and remove features). They are also
            just stronger at max value than the other ones we had. <br> (Unfortunately we had to change them again to a 
            another different kind but the alternatives were basically just as good)

        <!-- Simulation -->
        <section id="cta" class="main">
            <h2>Simulation</h2>
            <img class = 'console_image' src="images/training.jpg" alt="">
            <p>To get this car driving on it's own, we had to train an AI model. Using a
                driving simulator and hours of in it, we were able training data for the model to
                read. As you can see in the video below, the virtual track actually looks very
                similar to the real world track </p>
            <div class="auto-resizable-iframe"><div>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KbJP21gSCIs?modestbranding=1&rel=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div></div>
            <p>We uploaded these models to the car and it was able to detect the same lines. 
                Results were streamed on twitch
            </p>

            <h2>Tuning - Distracted Robot</h2>
            <div class="auto-resizable-iframe"><div>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bv1gfSw-x_o?modestbranding=1&rel=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div></div>
            <p>A this point, the car worked, but had a lot of tweaking to do
                Our robot was programmed to follow the orange line, but as a side effect, 
                it got very easily distracted by anything else orange , like the cone it crashed into.</p>
                <img class = 'console_image' src="images/tweaks2.PNG" alt="">
            <p>This is a perspective of what we could tweak on the fly, and how we can change what the car
                can see. By adjusting filters and ranges for the camera's POV, we tuned how well the car could
                perceive what we wanted it to.

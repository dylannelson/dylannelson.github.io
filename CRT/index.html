				<h2>Nintendo Switch on 50 Year Old CRT</h2>
				<p>I found a CRT at a thrift shop and I fell in love with it's design. I love furniture made of wood
					and this was no exception. We used to have a room in my childhood home that had an old furnace, and 
					everything was wood and brick. So cozy. If I'm ever to have a room like that again, this would be 
					a fine addition. But I want it to be usable of course, so here's my journey at fixing up a TV that's 
					around 50 years old and 100% incompatable with ANY kind of modern media
				</p>

				<h3>Color Alignment</h3><hr><br>

				<i>Left is before color alignment, and right is after</i>
				<p>All the colors were terribly aligned. I had to tear everything apart to get 
					this far though. On this CRT, the only color adjustments you make were in the
					quantinty of color(i.e. a hole labled Red Scr. on the back which turns down ALL 
					red). To adjust the actual alignment I had to take the TV apart. After...</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Taking off 10 screws</li>
					<li>Breaking off a metal piece keeping the power cord in permanently</li>
					<li>Carefully not breaking off the antenna</li>
				</ul>
				<p>... I was able to get into the back of the TV</p>

				These were the last of the knobs that I tried, they were really well hidden, two 
				aren't visible in the pic but the green arrows point to their aprox location. <br><br>
				Despite the dozen or so easily visible knobs, the most important were the least visible
				with no indication of their purpose. After this thought the image quality was almost perfect
				<br><br>

				<h3>Vertical/Horizontal Hold</h3><hr>
				<p>
					When I first got this TV working, both these settings were way off, it was a trial and 
					error of spinning knobs till I got I even knew <i>what</i> the issue was, since nothing
					on the screen is sensible when these setting are wrong
				</p>
				<b>Vertical Hold</b> was one of the most important settings I had to fix. Vertical hold 
				when set wrong makes the image on the screen spin like a water wheel, falling down over 
				and over.<br>

				<b>Horizontal Hold</b>, like vertical hold, was one of the few that could be changed without
				taking the TV apart. The effects are less noticible than vertical hold, but still make a big
				difference when done right.<br>

            <p>The many costs a new car owner is faced with, versus the simple pricing of 
                a Flexcar. </p> 
            <p>The monthly costs of a Flexcar will be cheaper than most auto loans,
                and the basic insurance can rival that of most leading insurers.</p>
            <p>Another massive benefit of Flexcar is skipping all the other 
                required annual fees, such as repairs, maintenance, state tax, and registration.

            <p>One may think that ownership will beat out renting in the long term. </p>
            <p>Here we can see, that even after the car has been paid off, it takes
                years for the costs to come close with renting, but  they never intersect</p>
            <p>Flexcar rentals are proven to be valuable for both short and long term usage</p>

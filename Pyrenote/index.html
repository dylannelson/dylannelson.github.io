				<b>Abstract</b>
				<p>
					Pyrenote is a project in development by a growing group of student researchers here at UCSD. It's
					primary purpose is to allow anyone to contribute to research by labeling data in an intuitive and
					accessible way. Right now it is currently being used to develop a sort of voice recognition for
					birds. The goal is to make an algorithm that can strongly label data (say where in the clip a bird
					is calling and what bird is making the call). To do this, a very vast dataset is needed to be
					labeled. I worked mostly on the user experience side. Allowing them to interact with their labeling
					in new ways, such as keeping tabs on their progress and reaching goals. Developing a User Profile
					page was the primary source for receiving this data and was developed iteratively as a whole new
					page for the site

				<h4 id="using_pyre">Using Pyrenote</h4>
				<p>
					As a user of Pyrenote I came up with a few ideas and improvements I wanted to implements. In the
					end, my team and I decided to make a User Profile page. Engaging users is key to the Pyrenote
					workflow, because without users, there is no content to be generated. We set out to incorporate a
					user page with a few goals in mind: <br>
					<ul>
						<li>To allow users to track their progress on their own, in real time</li>
						<li>To allow users to access previously annotated clips, in case there was an error, incomplete
							labeling, or anything else.</li>
						<li>To allow managers to organize and access all this data better as well, without manual 
							intervention</li>
					</ul>
					Through this process we assessed each of these, and have plans and the potential to do much more.

				<p>
					This was the first set of users we identified and decided we needed to work for. There is 
					different data for each and different ways to access the data so it will allow the development
					of each part to work fairly iteratively

				<p>
					The first prototype I made and presented to the team. Developed in <b>Figma</b> and shared in 
					our weekly meetings. I eventually got a lot of feedback that paved my direction for the following
					quarter. A lot more data was desired and organized in a different way

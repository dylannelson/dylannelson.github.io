        <hr>
        <p> 
            I have quite a bit of computer hardware experience, but I don't
            get to practice it much since industries have pushed towards
            cloud computing. Self hosting is still a valuable skill and works
            great for smaller projects and particular use cases where cloud
            isn't required. Also many skills are transferable, such as using
            docker or setting up firewall.

            <h2>Operating System - Linux</h2><hr>
            <p>For the OS, I chose the Linux <u><a class="highlight" href="https://ubuntu.com/download/server">Ubuntu Server</a></u>
                since it's widely used and has lots of documentation. It's also free and
                relatively easy to setup. They also provide a free desktop OS, which
                helps bring in users and developers</p> 
            <p>Using a Linux server has a few benefits. Being a server OS, 
                it's designed to be <span class="highlight">"headless."</span> Headless means that
                there's no desktop, and it's interacted with through a terminal. 
                Similar to the original computers. This ultimately 
                <span class="highlight">saves resources</span> and

        <section id="cta3" class="main">
            <hr><h2>Software</h2><hr>
            <p>My first project was getting a gaming server setup. I wanted to use Minecraft due to it's relatively open source nature</p>
            <u><h3>Setting up Java Developer Kit</h3></u>
            <p>Normally, this is a pretty  simple setup. Even using ChatGPT, it suggest running 
                <ul class="custom-list"><li><i>sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless</i></li></ul><br>
                This used to work and was the case for years, but in this case, the AI models like GPT and Gemini are outdated: </p>
                <img class = 'small_image' src="images/jdk.PNG" alt="">
            <p>But according to the <u><a class="highlight" href = 'https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w14a'> and official patch notes</a></u> and <u><a class="highlight" href = 'https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w14a'> the wiki</a></u>, 
                it's been using Java 21 since Apr 2024, so be careful blindly trusting AI. Run this instead:
                <ul class="custom-list"><li><i>sudo apt install openjdk-21-jre-headless</i></li></ul><br></p>
            
            <u><h3>Open Ports in Linux</h3></u>
            <p>The server needs to know where to allow and direct traffic. This allows people from outside 
                the network (others online) to connect to the server. The standard minecraft port is <u>25565</u>
                but any port works. To open this port run:
                <ul class="custom-list"><li><i>sudo ufw allow 25565</i></li></ul><br></p>
            
            <u><h3>Retrieve the Installer</h3></u>
            <p>The installer will be a .jar file provided <u><a class="highlight" href = 'https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server'>here</a></u>
                Copy the link to the .jar file like seen below:
                <img src="images/link.PNG" class = 'small_image' alt=""></p>
                <p>The reason we want the link, and not the file downloaded, is we can automatically download it with a command on the server. Run:</p>
                <ul class="custom-list"><li><i>wget https://...</i></li></ul>
                <p> Replace  the "https://..." with the actual link and it will download it to the current directory From there you can run:</p>
                <ul class="custom-list"><li><i>java -Xmx4GB -Xms4GB -jar server.jar nogui</i></li></ul>
                <p>and this will get the server setup going.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Network -->
        <section id="cta4" class="main">
            <hr><h2>Network</h2><hr>
            <p>To allow others to access the server, the router needs to know that it can direct traffic in and out.
                It needs to be told what traffic to allow (request to port 25565), and where (to the local IP of the server)</p>
            <u><h3>Port Forwarding</h3></u>
            <p>To access the router's settings, you need to find the network's "Default Gateway" on the
                non-server device. This can be done by running the command "ipconfig" in Command Prompt, or  the equivalent in other terminals</p> 
            <p>The default gateway will look something like "192.168.__.__" and can be copy pasted into the browser to access the UI for the
                router:</p>
            <img src="images/port.PNG" class = 'small_image' alt="">
            <p>This is an example of what it may look like after navigating to the Port Forwarding tab. By filling out this form
                you can expose the server to the web and allow others to connect. Specifics for port forwarding vary a lot depending on the device.
            </p>
            <u><h3>Networking Notes:</h3></u>
            <ol>
                <li><u>Protocol Option</u> 
                    <ul class="custom-list"><li>
                        The form will request you chose a protocol. There are many options, but TCP is the only
                        one required by Minecraft. Some say TCP+UDP is the right option, but UDP is not used
                    </li></ul>
                <li><u>Reverse Proxy</u>
                    <ul class="custom-list"><li>
                        It is very often suggested to setup a reverse proxy to handle disguising your IP. For most
                        situations where you only share the IP with a few people, don't leave it on 24/7, and don't have
                        anything sensitive in reach of the server, this may not be necessary,
                    </li></ul>
                <li><u>Domain Name</u>
                    <ul class="custom-list"><li>Along with the reverse proxy, you can use a custom domain name 
                        to further disguise your public IP. This isn't really hiding your IP, but allowing it to be
                        reached using a more easy to spell and remember name.
                    </li></ul>

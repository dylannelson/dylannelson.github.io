        <i>Tool for annotating bird calls</i><br><br>
        <b>Abstract</b>
        <p>
            Pyrenote is a project in development by a growing group of student researchers here at UCSD. Its
            primary purpose is to allow anyone to contribute to research by labeling data in an intuitive and
            accessible way. Right now it is currently being used to develop a voice recognition tool for
            birds. The goal is to make an algorithm that can strongly label data (say where in the clip a bird
            is calling and what bird is making the call). To do this, a very vast dataset is needed to be
            labeled. I worked mostly on the user experience side. Allowing them to interact with their labeling
            in new ways, such as keeping tabs on their progress and reaching goals. Developing a User Profile
            page was the primary source for receiving this data and was developed iteratively as a whole new
            page for the site
        </p>

        <h4 id="using_pyre">Using Pyrenote</h4>
        <p>
            As a user of Pyrenote I came up with a few ideas and improvements I wanted to implement. One of the
            main issues we faced was needing to ask our team leader, who was the only one who could access the
            data of our project, for updates. Each time we did this he had to manually go through the data,
            parse it, and deliver it to us (manually). This is something that can clearly be automated and
            delivered directly to the user. In the end, my team and I decided to make a User Profile page.
            Engaging users is key to the Pyrenote workflow, and we need users to be content, because without
            good users, we don't have data.. We set out to incorporate a user page with a few goals in mind: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>To allow users to track their progress on their own, in real time</li>
                <li>To allow users to access previously annotated clips, in case there was an error, incomplete
                    labeling, or anything else.</li>
                <li>To allow managers to organize and access all this data better as well, without manual 
                    intervention</li>
            </ul>
            Through this process we assessed each of these, and strived for even greater.
        </p>

        <p>
            This was the first set of users we identified and decided we needed to work for. There is 
            different data for each and different ways to access the data so it will allow the development
            of each part to work fairly iteratively

            quarter. A lot more data was desired and organized in a different way

            I met with one of our lead programmers and designers for the site. Sean helped
            me throughout this entire quarter and taught me during each step of my journey. First
            we went over the old prototype and discussed the limitations of it with respect to the
            currently developed code. Some things were going to be a lot harder to develop than others.
            We knew we <i>could</i> develop everything we had pictured, but only with enough time.
            So we set priorities and I made a new prototype
        </p>
        
        <h4 id='Prototype2'>Prototype 2</h4>
        <img class="console_image" src="images/p2.PNG" alt="*missing image of prototype 2">
        <i class="console_image">Prototype 2, many more stats</i> 
        <p>New Insights
            <ul>
                <li>A whole new section to distinguish between groups</li>
                <li>Group Specific data for each clip</li>
                <li>A limit to how many clips are shown (not all/infinite)</li>
                <li>Rephrasing for some words and tables</li>
            </ul>
            After this I drew up the changes and made that second demo above. Next was to get that
            working in the frontend code, which went smoothly given I already had a working demo 
            from before
        </p>

        <h4 id='NewFrontend'>New Frontend</h4>
        <img class="console_image" src="images/front2.PNG" alt="*missing image of front 2">
        <i class="console_image"'>Frontend Complete, working in react and docker</i> <br>
        <p>
            Works pretty similar to the previous demo and looks similar to the new prototype
            some adjustments need to be made but that can be done easily. Now we just need to
            hook it up to the backend
        </p>
        
        <h4 id='NewBackend'>New Backend</h4>
        <p>
            The backend was able to be incorporated partially with ease. After a few meetings
            and much more learning. We were able to get some variables in that worked and delivered
            exactly what we wanted. Most of the other functionality is still a work in progress
            because it requires writing all new backend code, which I was not previously familiar
            or experienced with. The tables are a whole level of complexity harder than everything
            we've done so far, and certainly take time. <br>
            Sean taught me a lot and I got access to everything on the backend that I need. We
            successfully got the page setup to accept data and API calls and tested a few and they work.
            Everything else is diving into the massive data structures and coding them to search and display
            correctly (which has been easier said than done)
        </p>

        <!-- <h4>What Now?</h4>
        <p>
            Honestly just trying to get things out. I'm learning a lot while trying to develop the 
            backend code, but with that comes a lot of issues. I was overzealous with how much I 
            I thought I could learn and do in these last few weeks of the quarter, but I'm proud of
            how far I've come and will continue working and see this project through. If you're actually
            reading this and made it this far, please let me know what you think. Thank you

        <h3>1. Creating New Page</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add a item to the navbar in <i>audino/frontend/src/containers/navbar.js</i>
                <ul>

                    <li>NOTE: The directory (the “to = …”) of the file here matters, it must be the same 
                        as the JS file you will create</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Create a JS file with the same name in audino/frontend/src/pages. Mine will be titled 
                <b>“profilePage.js”</b> </li>
            <li>In <i>audino/frontend/src/pages/index.js</i>, assign a name to the page in a new import line, 
                and then add that name to the list of exports
                <ul>
                    <li><img src="images/indx.PNG" alt="" class="console_image"></li>
                    <li>The first highlighted line was added entirely, and the second line <b>“Profile”</b> 
                        was simply added to the set</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Establish a private route to the new JS script in audino/frontend/src/app.js, allowing it to
                be found by other files
                <ul>
                    <li><img src="images/app1.PNG" alt="" class="console_image"></li>
                    <li>Add “Profile” (or the name of the page) to the initial import of the same file</li>
                    <li><img src="images/app2.PNG" alt="" class="console_image"></li>
                    <li>Add a private route as well. This should be in the render portion, near the end of the script</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <!-- <h3>2. Creating Dynamic Stats</h3>
        <p>This is the first example I implemented of dynamic backend code working for the front end.
            I will explain it in a more general way so some logic can apply to other applications. The code is vast
            though so I recommend looking at the source code as well if your goal is to actually implement 
            something like this.
